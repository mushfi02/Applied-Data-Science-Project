# Predicting Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Success ðŸš€  

Welcome to the **Predicting Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Success** project! This repository contains the code, data, and insights from a data science capstone project. The goal is to predict whether the first stage of a Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully, enabling a startup to compete with SpaceX in the commercial space exploration market.  

## Project Overview  
This project simulates the work of a data scientist in a real-world setting. By applying the **Data Science Methodology**, we explore and analyze data, build predictive models, and present findings to support informed decision-making for a startup rivaling SpaceX.  

### Context  
SpaceXâ€™s Falcon 9 rocket has revolutionized space travel with its ability to reuse its first stage, significantly reducing launch costs to $62 million per launch compared to competitors charging over $165 million. By predicting the success of first-stage landings, this project helps estimate potential savings and aids a competing startup in making competitive bids.  

### Key Objectives  
1. **Understand the Problem**: Evaluate the significance of first-stage reusability in reducing launch costs.  
2. **Analyze Data**: Perform data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization.  
3. **Build Predictive Models**: Develop machine learning models to predict first-stage landing outcomes.  
4. **Communicate Results**: Provide actionable insights and recommendations to stakeholders.  

## Project Steps  
1. **Data Collection**: Gather data on Falcon 9 launches, including landing outcomes and associated parameters.  
2. **Data Wrangling**: Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values and inconsistencies.  
3. **EDA and Visualization**: Explore patterns and trends to gain insights into factors affecting landing success.  
4. **Model Development**: Train machine learning models to predict landing success.  
5. **Model Evaluation**: Compare model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.  
6. **Reporting**: Summarize findings, model results, and business recommendations in a stakeholder-friendly format.  

## Technologies and Tools  
- **Python**: Programming language for data manipulation and modeling.  
- **Libraries**:  
  - `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation.  
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.  
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning model development.  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive coding and analysis.
